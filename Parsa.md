🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a senior Computer Engineering student and a full-stack developer specializing in Next.js. I learn extremely fast, and one of my strongest skills is problem-solving—I don’t stop until every bug is fixed, no matter how long it takes.

Right now, I’m building my own team and startup called NeoVoid, aiming to deliver bigger, more creative, and more impactful projects. For me, full-stack development isn’t just a skill—it’s a long-term path I’m committed to mastering.
